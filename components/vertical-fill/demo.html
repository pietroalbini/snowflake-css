<p>
    This component extends the size of the element to the full width of the
    container, and in the case of <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> to the full width
    of the page. If there is empty space left the last child is extended to
    cover everything remaining.
</p>

<p>
    To use the component simply apply the <code>.vertical-fill</code> class.
